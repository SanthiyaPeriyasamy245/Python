 
 Python
 
 1. It's supports both functional and oop language.

 2. it's used in distributed environment

 3.  it's  platform independent language.
  
 4. (processor + os = platform)

 5. source code -> compile -> byte code (pyc) -> pvm (python virtual machine ) -> machine code.
  
6. # creating object.
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

# Creating an object using the constructor
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
print(car1.brand, car1.model)  # Output: Toyota Corolla

7. Ensuring Script Runs Only When Executed Directly in Python 
class Display:
    def printing(self):
        print("hello")


if __name__ == '__main__':

    # "Run this part of the code only if this script is executed directly, not when imported into another script."
    
    # _name__ is a special built-in variable in Python.

    # It stores the name of the current script/module.

    # Its value changes based on how the script is executed:
    
    obj = Display()  # Creating an object of the class
    obj.printing()   # Calling the method
